00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,400
[MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,980
(upbeat music)

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:09,980
We are the ones who, reading the code, look for the asshole who wrote that shit.

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:14,480
But, alas, the asshole is not the same, he wrote it right yesterday.

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,980
We are the ones who sanctify the new JavaScript framework, secretly preferring jQuery.

6
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:26,980
The same for which testing is important, in fact, our codebase has only two tests, and flakes too.

7
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:30,980
We are the ones who make your language sucks, but mine is worse.

8
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:36,980
Those who clarify it in the comment messages first of all, and inside, he calls it all saints.

9
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:41,980
Those who talk on call for 5 minutes before realizing that the mic is mute.

10
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:48,980
Those who can't do default, it quickly becomes a "everything is possible" if you have resources, time and limited budget.

11
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:54,980
We are the ones who have the AI regulated, have you ever seen this new model that kitten funamboli will design?

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:58,980
Those who depend on it and join the prison for free.

13
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,980
and those who make the RAL...

14
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,980
no, come on, it's already funny like this.

15
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:06,980
We are the ones who make the slalom

16
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,980
among the specifics that change constantly,

17
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:11,980
now resigned that the definition of ready

18
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,980
is just a pia illusion.

19
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,980
Those who feel like saying

20
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,980
"I have an idea for an app"

21
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,980
and it's immediately the umpteenth social

22
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,980
like Instagram, but better.

23
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:27,980
We are the ones who, despite the failed deploy,

24
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:35,980
The seat is red, the business is fucked up, we are in front of a bar and everything seems a little less serious.

25
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:50,980
Hello and welcome to Get Bar, finally in video! It's really cool to give you the chance to enter our circle of developers.

26
00:01:50,980 --> 00:02:01,980
I really have to say it! I'm really excited, I'm excited to open the doors, I'm excited to pour beer in this virtual pub.

27
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:08,980
I'm excited, but I won't forget that Gitbar is a podcast.

28
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:11,980
I want to make a small premise.

29
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:15,980
Gitbar is and will always be a podcast.

30
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,980
Where by podcast we mean a RSS feed.

31
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:27,980
I know, we don't like XML, but RSS is the only use of XML that makes sense.

32
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:41,980
So, GitBar will continue to be an audio podcast, with the possibility to see it and to use it in an increased way, through the video on YouTube, and then we'll see how to evolve.

33
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:45,980
I don't know if you've seen the new acronym, it tells a little bit about who we are.

34
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:49,980
and I use the plural

35
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,980
also because Gitbar is not a brainwrap

36
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,980
but a group of people

37
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,980
and the first people I want to thank

38
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,980
for this evolution of Gitbar

39
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,980
are my co-hosts, the baristas

40
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,980
the people who pour drinks in this

41
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,980
province of pubs

42
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,980
for all the frustrated developers

43
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,980
and I have with me Leo and Carmine

44
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,980
Hi guys, how are you?

45
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,980
Hi, all good.

46
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:21,980
Unfortunately we are in video mode, so I can't say hello to you from my pool villa in Dubai,

47
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:25,980
which was the beginning I wanted to give to this new season, but it's okay anyway.

48
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:32,980
You don't have, let's say, the passive intro, it wasn't as passive as you expected.

49
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,980
Exactly, exactly. I put this green screen of a normal house.

50
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:40,980
In fact, I also put the green screen. As you can see, everything is very static,

51
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:45,980
Static, this image is really stock, with our great and powerful tools.

52
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,980
Thanks to the donors, who can allow us to make these videos.

53
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:52,980
Donate, so I can also put it on a fridge here.

54
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:58,980
Exactly, our video experience has costs, so if you like to support us,

55
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:03,980
please do it, you can find everything on www.gitbar.it

56
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:08,980
and on one of the last frames of this episode.

57
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:13,980
We have great things in store for the fourth season of Geekbar.

58
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:19,980
We have a series of ideas that are fermenting a bit, like good wine.

59
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:23,980
I think this episode is already a bit too alcoholic, but...

60
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:32,980
I was saying, they are fermenting and you will find many, many news, but I will not spoil you more.

61
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:45,480
Guys, today we're talking about open source and framework, which are two hot topics

62
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:49,480
But before we do that, we have to quickly remind our contacts

63
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:54,480
The contacts remain the same, despite this podcast refresh

64
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,480
info@gitbar.it and www.gitbar.it

65
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:02,480
@BrainRepo on Twitter, but...

66
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,480
Go Carmine, it's your turn today.

67
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,480
Today it's me as always.

68
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,480
We remind you of our Telegram group.

69
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:16,480
You can find us on Telegram by typing "Gitbar" on your favorite Telegram client.

70
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:20,480
We are more than a thousand, actually we are more than a thousand and more than a thousand people.

71
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:25,480
We are waiting for you too and remembering that we are the group that distinguishes itself.

72
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,480
This time I'm not saying anything about you, so we don't cut you off.

73
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,480
Exactly, we're at 1417.

74
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,480
I remember we were around 1300.

75
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,480
I must have missed a few.

76
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,480
There's a bot problem on Telegram, like on Twitter, on X.

77
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,480
Ah, there's a bot. We don't have the bot tool.

78
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,480
No, it's a joke.

79
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:51,480
Clearly, they're all normal users, because we have the bots and we catch them right away.

80
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:57,720
I think I'm completely crazy this period of losing everything

81
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:03,320
But that's okay, that's okay, we were focused on this passage to the video of Geetvar

82
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:08,600
It's already been seven minutes and we haven't started the episode yet and this is starting to worry me

83
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,600
Well, five minutes was the opening so...

84
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,600
Yes, it's true, it's true, it's true

85
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:17,760
It means that we will have to make a reduced version, I promise

86
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,760
In the next episode we will have a reduced version and we keep this as a trailer.

87
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:27,760
But, let's get to work. It's time to introduce our guest.

88
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:46,760
Here we are, here we are. Today we have with us a friend, a colleague too,

89
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:54,760
Senior Software Developer at NearForm and a Core Contributor at Fastify

90
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:58,760
We see him more and more often at conferences

91
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,760
We have with us our friend Manuel Spigolon

92
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,760
Hi Manuel, how are you?

93
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:07,760
Hi to all the hosts and a greeting to the audience of the Gitbar

94
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,760
I'm sorry, I said "hosts"

95
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,760
because anyway...

96
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,760
It's beautiful, from now on we'll use this appellative

97
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,760
Thank you for the idea. Hi Manuel

98
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,760
Today you finally came to see us

99
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,760
and you know that I

100
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,760
I've been going through

101
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,760
the things you've said around

102
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,760
to try to understand

103
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,760
your idea of many things

104
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,760
The first topic we wanted to address with you

105
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,760
was the one from the Hello World to the open source.

106
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:49,760
When you are a developer, there are a series of stages.

107
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,760
There is the Hello World stage, where the first experiments begin,

108
00:07:53,760 --> 00:08:00,760
better said, fueled by the idea of a side project,

109
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:04,760
which is the spark that pushes the experimentation towards a language,

110
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:09,760
to a framework, to whatever has a code underneath.

111
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,760
Then there's the transition a little further

112
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,760
to the open source world.

113
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,760
Not everyone takes this leap, many are scared.

114
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,760
I want to know, though,

115
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:28,760
as a Java programmer,

116
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,760
as you said at the beginning of your career,

117
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,760
you think I got away with it, right?

118
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:39,760
to a core contributor of a widely used framework, Fastify

119
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,760
what are the milestones that you recognize

120
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:52,760
that lead you to say "there was this transition, this transition" and so on?

121
00:08:52,760 --> 00:09:08,760
Ok, so now I will say a bit about buzzwords, because otherwise you can't define yourself as a developer if you don't say "comfort zone" to start

122
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:14,760
So the concept is "stay hungry and stay foolish" obviously

123
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,760
thank you, thank you

124
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,760
what happened?

125
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:25,760
the developer, like many others, basically

126
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,760
at the beginning I started working

127
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,760
I hadn't even finished high school, actually

128
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,760
because I already had the employment contract

129
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:41,760
and I hadn't yet passed the famous state exam

130
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,760
it was very funny

131
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:49,760
and what happened? I fell in love with the company I worked for

132
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:55,760
I fell in love with the people I worked with

133
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:06,760
but, actually, when I started the first Milestone, when I started to participate in the first conferences

134
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:13,760
I saw these developers on stage and I was ecstatic

135
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,760
by how they managed to involve the audience

136
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:23,760
and how they worked on projects that for me were really science fiction.

137
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:30,760
And there was the first seed that instilled in me

138
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:37,760
I had this desire to be like these "famous" people

139
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,760
in my eyes, clearly

140
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,760
and so this was the first step

141
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:52,760
the second step was to throw myself on the latest technology that was fashionable in those years

142
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,760
in the JS, in particular

143
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:03,280
and so I simply filled the free time I had studying this language

144
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:09,280
and in the end there's the exit from the comfort zone

145
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:21,280
that is, to abandon the work, let's say, that is quiet and warm, as comfortable as winter blankets

146
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:28,280
and tell my boss, with whom I've been working for almost 10 years,

147
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:42,280
"Look, I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, and I even had the opportunity to move to a new city,

148
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:46,280
get out of the house's nest

149
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:52,280
and start living alone and paying the bills

150
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,280
and so it was really a

151
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,280
how to say

152
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,280
a breaking wave

153
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:05,280
that single grain of the conference

154
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,280
to start participating in conferences

155
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,280
Manuel, sorry if I interrupt you

156
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:16,280
I want to ask you a question, because in my opinion it's one of the most interesting passages.

157
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:24,280
You said that you left the company for which you had been working for many years.

158
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,280
Exactly.

159
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:32,280
I want to return to this concept, because actually many people I talk to,

160
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:39,280
who have to make that leap in terms of seniority, who have to go and run after those stimuli,

161
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:45,280
They say "Yes, but the company I work for is a family.

162
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:55,280
And the break-up of these ties, which also have an emotional relationship, becomes devastating.

163
00:12:55,280 --> 00:13:00,280
I remember when I left my company.

164
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:06,280
For me it was a deep crisis of identity.

165
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:15,280
leaving all the ties, leaving the certainties, but above all the people with whom you had built something that, being a small company,

166
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:21,280
and I don't know how big your company was initially, but mine was really small, so it was more like a family,

167
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:33,280
and it was like the son who falls in love with the girl who ran away from home and leaves leaving the parents, a kind of son to the prodigal, right?

168
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:38,280
How did you experience this distance, this separation?

169
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:45,280
I lost a bit of time, sorry if you're frozen

170
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,280
but I'm trying to answer the question

171
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:56,280
how was it to leave the company for which I worked for 9 years and 4 months

172
00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:01,280
and I remember it because it was really bad for us

173
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:06,280
because when you gave up irrevocably

174
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:16,280
it seemed like if you had shot him

175
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:22,280
I felt a bit repudiated, I have to admit it

176
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:36,280
and this didn't do me any good, on the contrary, I thought "well, I was just a number, the number 8"

177
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:44,280
and so it made me realize that yes, we are all "a big family"

178
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:51,620
but in the end the money you make doesn't go into my pocket

179
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:57,620
and you're a person who has to make money

180
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:00,620
so that's how I felt

181
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:04,020
so it wasn't great, honestly

182
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:09,620
I would have imagined a goodbye where we would hug each other crying

183
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,620
"thank you for the time we spent together"

184
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:17,620
but it wasn't like that, and I'm a bit sorry about that.

185
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,620
But...

186
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:24,620
Sorry, I'll intervene for a moment, because you said that you gave them irrevocable submissions,

187
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:30,620
so you didn't leave them any space to try and see if they were up to it.

188
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:33,620
You already had your idea, you made Ben go for it,

189
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:38,620
so considering the reaction of people, one who sees himself in front of them and says,

190
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,620
"Look, you can do anything, but I'm leaving."

191
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:46,620
I was invincible because it wasn't a matter of money

192
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:53,620
It's weird to say, but here money didn't matter

193
00:15:53,620 --> 00:16:01,620
Only the cool projects I saw during the talks mattered

194
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,620
the technological stack was in the way

195
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,620
and so

196
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,620
everything else was

197
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,620
an excuse

198
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,620
to not decide

199
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,620
to make the big leap

200
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,620
Moving forward

201
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,620
with the career

202
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,620
I wanted to

203
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,620
understand for a moment

204
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,620
how and what was your first

205
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,620
contact

206
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,620
with open source

207
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,620
the moment you connected the socket

208
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:34,620
"Ok, now I have to do something, raising my hands, right?"

209
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:41,620
Absolutely. And here too, we are filming in the buzzwords,

210
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:47,620
because we are in this new city, in this new company,

211
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:52,620
in this new adventure, because the technological stack is totally different.

212
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:58,620
we are talking about the leap you made from Java with Oracle

213
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:04,620
practically in a banking environment, so really hyper-limited and limiting

214
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:12,620
towards Node.js, MongoDB, Redis and other nice companies

215
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:22,620
and what was the thing that supported me in all this migration journey

216
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:32,620
was the fact that I was in a new city, alone, and so I really spent the nights studying

217
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,620
"Punto"

218
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:39,620
Like a student, I would go there in the morning

219
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:44,620
on some books, some tutorials on YouTube,

220
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:49,620
and buzzwords, motivational videos,

221
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,620
as if there was no tomorrow.

222
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:56,620
There I learned the impostor syndrome,

223
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:59,620
there I learned a lot of nice things,

224
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:10,620
and we can say that the "too long, didn't read" is simply "tu sei l'unico responsabile della tua formazione"

225
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:14,620
"non devi demandare all'azienda questa cosa"

226
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:19,620
and that's where I made the first step towards open source

227
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:29,620
I took the holidays, I paid myself, I think, a lot of money, we're talking about 300-500 euros

228
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:36,620
of course, kept by Matteo Collina. This was my first contact with Open Source.

229
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:43,620
So it's not a bit like the motivational videos said, just imagine and you'll have it,

230
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:48,620
like The Secret, right? It would be great to take a piece of The Secret and put it in the video,

231
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,620
but I'm sure they'll strike it

232
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:55,620
but in the end you opened the wallet

233
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,620
armed with patience and guts

234
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,620
and you said to yourself

235
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:03,620
"ok, now I start"

236
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:11,620
Is this the first merge request or is this the one you want?

237
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:21,620
This is nice, because I did it on December 24th, 2018, if I remember correctly

238
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:25,620
You even remember the time, at this point

239
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:28,620
We can check on Github if it's true

240
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,620
Towards the evening, if I remember correctly

241
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:35,620
This was the first real pull request towards Fastify, if I remember correctly

242
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:45,620
So I let you imagine the fantastic evenings that we spent together

243
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:48,620
How did you get to this PURE QUEST?

244
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:53,620
Because everyone says "take a good first issue"

245
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:56,620
Exactly, a simple good first issue, but you get pissed off

246
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:02,140
Every time you go to get it, how many times I write to myself in private and I tell him take a

247
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:05,780
Good first issue first good issue

248
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:13,260
We mix the words as you want to say it, but every time I suggest this the answer I get is

249
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:19,620
Well, my friends, but all the good first issue have a comment below, can I take it?

250
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:24,140
Yes, and they are almost all taken and in the end

251
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:29,500
Yes, it's easy to say, but 90% of the cases don't work.

252
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,500
Sorry, this is my bold opinion.

253
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:38,500
No, no, so, it's true, there are also many who say "I'll do it and you'll never see them again"

254
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:46,500
and then the concept is "take it and do it" without being here to threaten the camperlaya.

255
00:20:46,500 --> 00:21:01,500
I know, but at that point Galatea comes in. I want to get to the concept of Galatea, of open source, because it's something that is very close to my heart. Sorry if I interrupt you.

256
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:08,500
No, no, no, go easy, go easy. I'll answer the previous question first, otherwise I'll lose it.

257
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:14,500
So, what was the engine for the first pull request?

258
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:18,500
Always at the course of Matteo Collina.

259
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:27,500
In the end, he did teach me a lot of things about Node.js, how it works, etc.

260
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:38,780
but in the breaks, listening to his stories, listening to his sentences, even banal questions

261
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:45,180
but that basically destroy all the opinion you have of yourself

262
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:52,860
because obviously there was a moment of sharing on the group, of the studio

263
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:58,460
in which many people were complaining about the company

264
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:04,460
many, not all, but several people were there self-financing

265
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:11,460
and so they said "my company thinks it doesn't need this, it thinks it doesn't need that other"

266
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:14,460
and Matteo said "why are you still there?"

267
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:21,460
"I don't know how to change, I'm graduating, I have to plan"

268
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:28,460
1000 excuses of answer and he says and Matteo answers

269
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:36,460
"Look, you can start to get some experience in open source, so you have the possibility to find mentors

270
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:45,460
because if in your company you are the best and you don't have the opportunity to change in a better company

271
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:56,460
You are surely blocked for the fact of mentoring. Go to the open source, you will find some maintainer that will lead you by the hand.

272
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:02,460
And above all, how to start? Start from the issues that no one wants to do.

273
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:07,460
Don't worry, you will receive loads non-stop.

274
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:13,460
And so my first pull request is the documentation. Documentation as if there was no tomorrow.

275
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:16,460
[Italian]

276
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:22,980
From what you were representing, you created the image

277
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:26,640
Today I'm caustic, be patient

278
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,380
I know you, I love you Manuel, so I can afford it with you

279
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:39,300
You represented, you represent, I always represent the maintainers, the contributors

280
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:44,020
Open Source is like San Francesco or Santa Rita,

281
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:48,020
which take you by the hand in the magical world of Open Source.

282
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:52,220
Actually, every time I did Open Source,

283
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:55,220
maintaining, rather than taking me by the hand, was given to me by ciphones.

284
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:58,020
And ciphones that were also quite powerful.

285
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:04,420
Important ciphones, but still ciphones.

286
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:12,420
On the other hand, I understand that for a maintainer, for a core contributor,

287
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:16,420
a fixed presence, that you read the Emerge Requests,

288
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:22,420
and it filters among tens, if not hundreds of "puttanate" that people write,

289
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:29,420
it becomes difficult to keep a certain lucidity,

290
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:34,820
and always be the San Francesco or the saint of the situation.

291
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:44,320
So, actually, often times, we see answers that are not really soft,

292
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,320
that, I repeat, have their importance.

293
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:52,820
So I wanted for a moment to move to the concept of the contributor and the maintainer,

294
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:56,320
the figure of the contributor and the maintainer.

295
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:03,920
I've noticed that you're always present in the threads of the Emerging Quests and the Ishu

296
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,320
You're quite active from that point of view

297
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:11,920
How do you keep a certain lucidity?

298
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:22,320
So, the first question I'm asking you, which is more of a provocation

299
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:28,720
"Did those slaps you received were instructive or not?"

300
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:34,320
This is something that one should ask oneself

301
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:42,320
And anyway, yes, you need to have a bit of hair on your stomach

302
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,320
to allow me this "sillogismo"

303
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,320
Basically, it depends a lot on the personality

304
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,320
I, for example, am not the type of person who gets it

305
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,320
I'm really...

306
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,320
quite... I mean, you can tell me anything

307
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,320
and I don't care

308
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:05,320
and I definitely noticed that in open source

309
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:09,320
the more a person has repositories

310
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:17,320
the more he tends to reduce the number of words he uses during the review

311
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:32,840
But I learned that, by concentrating carefully, I read the reviews that were made 2000 times, I searched, I documented myself and I learned

312
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:44,200
I didn't take for granted "look, he's telling me that he doesn't want my code, he's telling me that this if doesn't work" etc.

313
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:54,200
I'm learning to relate better with people, with "superiors"

314
00:26:54,200 --> 00:27:04,200
because if we relate this dialogue as if it were a job

315
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:13,200
you have a higher level, a person who is telling you to correct the code you wrote

316
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:25,600
and so, in my opinion, thanks to their being chaotic sometimes, which then, being chaotic, never offends the person

317
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:30,640
they write to you "look, here the code is not right, here I would do it in another way"

318
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:37,840
nothing transcendental, surely the fourth time you make a pull request, they turn you a bit

319
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:43,440
but every time you rewrite it, you rewrite it better and better

320
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,240
and this approach then, you bring it to work

321
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:54,640
and learning communication in the world of work is very important

322
00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:03,240
so contributing to open source has made my shoulders wide and even more solid

323
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:11,560
and all this interaction I bring it to work and it benefits the same work

324
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:20,120
because I learned that when you have a maintainer that presents a bug without the code to replicate it, for example

325
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:24,840
the maintainer says "look, bye" and closes it immediately

326
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:28,600
but they do it like that also on StarCoverFlow, in parentheses

327
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:35,100
The fact is that if I open a bug I get good answers

328
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,600
Same thing at work

329
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:41,100
If I ask for help and I say what I did, how I did it

330
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:48,100
and providing the code that makes sense to exist

331
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:52,100
I get smart answers

332
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,600
or I get coherent answers

333
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:59,840
Otherwise, try to reinstall and restart the PC

334
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,840
Let's finish there

335
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,840
I'm inserting myself with a motivational sentence

336
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,440
that if you want to have more, you have to give more

337
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,520
If you want to have better answers, you have to ask better questions

338
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:16,480
And then I also wanted to express a thought about the fact that even if the maintainer

339
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:23,120
who has this relationship, how to say, is the boss of the repository

340
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:32,720
Even if it doesn't answer you, it tries to answer you, but it doesn't answer 100 people in the same day.

341
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,720
And it does it anyway.

342
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:42,120
It's a stressful job for him, but for the project, we have to admit that we're not the only ones contributing to it.

343
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:46,520
This person does it, so if he spends time, even the least amount of time,

344
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,120
for which he writes you "bye" and closes the door,

345
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:52,520
he sees it and says "next time I'll do better because I want to improve the job".

346
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:55,020
so I think this thought is also included.

347
00:29:55,020 --> 00:30:00,520
I wanted to make a note for those who are listening to us

348
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:06,020
or are watching us, it's nice that this season the viewers are watching us,

349
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:10,520
who are maybe interested in making their first contribution

350
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:14,020
but are a little scared by this situation,

351
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:17,520
no one is going to eat you, in the sense that

352
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:25,120
Every project, every repo, every community is the mirror of our human interactions.

353
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:33,320
There are places, there are places, there are moments where it is possible to have a type of communication

354
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:40,720
that is even more welcoming for those who are starting.

355
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:47,120
There are maybe those days when you can do better, those days when you can do worse.

356
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:53,520
It was the right thing to do to make a point to go in that rhetoric

357
00:30:53,520 --> 00:31:03,920
so it's right if they answer you badly because "oh well, but I'm doing the validation library that you use and you didn't write it yourself"

358
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:13,280
and so ok, they are legitimate to do this thing, in the sense that they are a stupid person and stupid even if you have repositories with 15,000 stars

359
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:18,280
I heard you are a Storvald somewhere

360
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:28,280
No, no, my thing is a general thing, I mean, try us, if you don't like it, you have the chance to not like it too

361
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:40,280
Actually, I mentioned the concept of community because I wanted to connect to another thing, plus a question

362
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:58,280
I always have the impression that, if I have to choose a project that I want to follow, that I want to contribute, but also more extreme, that I want to use or not use,

363
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:02,780
for me it's very important, the type of community that you bring behind.

364
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:09,780
By type of community I mean the type of communication that happens in the community,

365
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:17,780
how the controversies are resolved, the various processes for which you can bring your idea to be an idea,

366
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:23,780
let's say, maybe to RFC, to implementation, etc.

367
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:41,780
and I noticed that often and willingly the proactivity of the community and the expectations of the community can differ

368
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:51,060
how do you manage, or how do you advise to manage the expectations of the company itself?

369
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:57,020
Because then, in a sense, you still enter that dynamic of social pressure of your peers,

370
00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:04,140
or at least in this case, let's say, of your clients, if we want to call them that,

371
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:06,340
who obviously have expectations.

372
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:13,140
and it's difficult to convey what's behind satisfying that expectation

373
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:21,860
because maybe the person is lucky and can contribute to that project as part of their work

374
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:26,100
so they are actually paid for a certain amount of hours that they can dedicate to that thing

375
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:31,860
and that's one of the sweet spots that you can reach

376
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:42,600
or maybe it's developing in the free time and so actually receiving a certain kind of pressure is not really a good thing

377
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:47,800
How do you relate to this and if you have any advice to give us?

378
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:56,680
So, I'll start with the simplest thing, that is, the quality of the community

379
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:07,680
I'll give you an example, at the moment, on active contributors, which are part of the Fastify collaborators,

380
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:17,680
there's a maintainer that's a bit sarcastic, for example, when they get questions that are a bit silly.

381
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:28,080
Also here, I say it in the first person, when I see messages that are not healthy

382
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:33,680
or at least can be misunderstood by a person who asked a question

383
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:41,280
"but why did you release this thing? It broke my whole production and I'm angry about it"

384
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:49,280
Also there, you don't have to take the anger of the people who write to you and throw it back

385
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:54,280
you have to teach respect to the person who is writing to you

386
00:34:54,280 --> 00:35:03,280
and so I have some messages, simply prefacts, in which I quote the mid-license

387
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:17,280
and you also try to train other contributors so that they spread good intentions in the environment

388
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:22,160
and so you try to train this person who got angry

389
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:27,960
by saying "look, if you're in production and I broke everything,

390
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:33,320
it means you're not working with a package lock"

391
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:37,520
and so you train them, you respond to hate with love

392
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:41,120
and this usually always pays off in the long run

393
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:48,120
There are maintainers that don't have time and don't answer, simply.

394
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:59,120
I instead have the time for a link, so I always try to give, to form, to be useful if I comment.

395
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:10,620
instead, but this is me now, in December I will be 5 years old as a contributor to Open Source

396
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:17,620
so I'm now a veteran, not to say a senior in this environment

397
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:20,120
you're a senior, right?

398
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,620
a little bit, yes

399
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:34,620
At the beginning of my "career" I felt all the pressure you mentioned

400
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:45,620
because in the first months of 2019 I made important changes to the validation part of Fastify

401
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:49,620
I can say that I did all the validation part of Fastify

402
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:52,620
Or better, I rewrote it, sorry

403
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:55,620
Thomas from Vedova wrote it

404
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:59,620
And then I refactored it on top

405
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:02,620
And then I rewrote it in parts

406
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:06,620
So, the first bugs

407
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:09,620
For me, I lost my hair

408
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:13,620
Because people wrote "oh, it's not working anymore"

409
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:17,620
"Why did it go up before? It's not going up anymore, what the hell did you do?"

410
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,620
And I felt guilty

411
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:23,620
And I had transformed my evenings

412
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:27,620
Maybe I had a free evening per week to watch a movie

413
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:33,620
No, I was up all night to fix that bug that I had caused

414
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:35,620
I felt guilty

415
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:42,620
It's like, I don't know, damaging a public property

416
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:48,140
you get anxious and try to repair it in some way

417
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:52,300
and this is not healthy, it's not healthy at all

418
00:37:52,300 --> 00:38:01,340
I haven't reached the extreme level where people would maybe taunt me on social media

419
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:08,220
- but still - no, I don't think we'll get to that point

420
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:16,700
but surely some emails that said "hey look, I have this issue, what do we do?"

421
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:24,900
so there was this feeling of debt towards the community

422
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:33,300
so maybe you had some experiences that you saw as third party

423
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:37,480
of burnout related to this topic here

424
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:42,320
because I imagine it can be a consequence

425
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:47,280
and then, in your opinion, another question like this, maybe this one too

426
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,880
a bit like this

427
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:56,880
the fact of being able to work and spend part of your working day

428
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,400
or work for an open source project

429
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,400
so being paid to do a certain thing

430
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:10,400
does it make you feel, or do you think it could make you feel less of this kind of pressure?

431
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:16,400
Like, "ok, it's my job, I created a bug, I'll fix it tomorrow morning"

432
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:23,400
So, to quote a story, without saying names and surnames

433
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:31,400
they kept forcing me to do something

434
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:45,400
saying "I have this pack, you haven't closed it yet, if you don't fix it I'll be fired, I have a family, I have kids, they won't be able to eat, what will I do? It's your fault"

435
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,920
but they told me this kind of stories

436
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:54,720
and so, receiving this kind of email...

437
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:59,040
I don't even want to think about it, luckily it didn't happen to me

438
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,440
because otherwise I don't know how I would react

439
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:10,560
but it's there that you understand that you have to "get off" the "you" person

440
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:18,560
and therefore your needs, your free time and your day

441
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,560
with the problems of others

442
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:27,560
Sometimes it's good to remember that you can't save the world every day

443
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:32,560
This is definitely something to remember

444
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:36,560
It's an open source project

445
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:46,060
and if you have a bug, maybe the previous version works, it does the pin of the dependency

446
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:53,060
at most you become an expert in suggesting workarounds, let's say

447
00:40:53,060 --> 00:41:01,060
you do the eye, or maybe you even suggest the approach to solve

448
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:08,560
in a constructive way to receive a better feedback from the community

449
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:12,560
rather than only bad emotions.

450
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:19,560
I want to ask you a question, shifting a bit to the side,

451
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:27,560
returning to the concept of contribution and speech on contributions.

452
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:35,560
I don't know, I'm getting a little detached in the thread, but I think it's ok.

453
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:42,560
What do you think, since I know you're also quite active on Stack Overflow,

454
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:55,560
what do you think is the difference between a commented issue and a thread on Stack Overflow?

455
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:59,560
Often, there's no difference.

456
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:06,560
I mean, I add a variable to your speech,

457
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:10,560
and those who ask for support on Discord,

458
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:15,560
I find them unbearable, in fact I'm not very active on Discord,

459
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:22,560
because it's a chat and there's too much communication that tends to be synchronous.

460
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,560
I don't like it at all.

461
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:31,560
I think that support is required on GitHub or Stack Overflow.

462
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:34,560
Stack Overflow is better in my opinion,

463
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:43,560
because it is more obvious and easier to find.

464
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:49,560
Or people read it more than GitHub.

465
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:58,760
But there is more vitality in the Fastify tag on Stack Overflow

466
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:02,040
but there is still not enough

467
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:06,760
because I think that if someone asks questions

468
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:11,880
the answers could be more useful for everyone

469
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,680
for all those who will have the same problem

470
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:21,680
So I prefer to stay on Stack Overflow for a long time between the two

471
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:26,680
and the best ones are the ones who ask the same question on Stack Overflow and GitHub

472
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:34,680
and then I systematically answer only on Stack Overflow and I close the issue on GitHub with the link to Stack Overflow

473
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:42,680
just to make it clear that a platform is enough, you don't need to write anywhere

474
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:49,680
We are talking about a lot of things that take a lot of time and therefore cost a lot of money

475
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:54,680
but this open source, who pays for it? Who has to pay for it? We have to pay for it, the company has to pay for it,

476
00:43:54,680 --> 00:44:02,680
you have to do the open collective, you have to not pay for it because it is right,

477
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:06,680
people who do open source and do not wash themselves do not need money

478
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:11,680
just because they live like this on the street with their computers

479
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,680
In your opinion?

480
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:26,680
I'll answer for myself, which is important, because from your previous question it seemed there was a bit of smoke in my kind of work.

481
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:35,680
I am paid to do my client project. I am not paid minimally to do open source.

482
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:45,680
All the open source I do, all the questions I answer, all the assistance, it's all free time.

483
00:44:45,680 --> 00:45:00,680
All my coffee breaks are spent maybe on spitting out the GitHub notifications or emails, but at the moment I'm not part of the team in NearForm,

484
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:05,680
we have a team in NearForm that normally works free time

485
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:10,680
I wanted to mention that, because at the same time there are "enlightened" companies

486
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:16,680
Absolutely, but unfortunately at the moment I'm not in that team

487
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:22,680
and therefore, I repeat, all my contributions are free time

488
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:26,680
and who pays it? At the moment no one

489
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:36,680
and the fact is that it depends a lot on the person, on how he feels repaid by the community

490
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:46,680
it's very important, because I would like to underline, if it wasn't clear, I started to contribute to Open Source for pure selfishness

491
00:45:46,680 --> 00:46:02,680
because I wanted a mentor, because I wanted a better job, because I wanted to work with the stars that went on stage during the conferences

492
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:08,680
and so that seemed to me to be the best way to reach my goals

493
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:19,080
and I received a lot, I keep saying that I still receive, precisely because I learn

494
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:26,280
what I learn by answering the questions, even the most disparate ones in some respects

495
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:30,680
then, clearly, I "resell" it to my work

496
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:38,680
as simply looking more professional, looking like someone who knows one more page of the book

497
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:44,680
so that job is... I consider it training

498
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:51,680
be careful, but it's not like that anymore in the last period

499
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:57,680
before moving on to the last period, which we talked about a bit

500
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:01,680
I know the situation you are living.

501
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:06,680
I want to ask you a question, I want to get to it like this.

502
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:11,680
We have said that a good part of our industry,

503
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,680
and we have always said it, a good part of our industry

504
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:18,680
is based, it has its roots in open source.

505
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:21,680
If there was no open source, probably our industry

506
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,680
would not be as it is.

507
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:30,680
We also have the numbers, if you want I can share them in the Telegram group, I was reading a beautiful book on open source.

508
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:37,680
We have the numbers that tell us that individual contributions are a very high number.

509
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:51,760
And at this point I ask myself, is it sustainable to bring an industry, an ecosystem that is

510
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:59,760
is repaid, for the most part, by visibility,

511
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:09,760
by the possibility of working with famous people or rock stars of the situation.

512
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:15,760
This thing is sustainable, because it's okay if it's selfish,

513
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:27,760
But if this driver, as selfish as it is, is as stable as the money that pays the contributions?

514
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:33,760
I think it's as stable as the sand in the Sahara, probably.

515
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:36,440
I think its stability is

516
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:39,160
fluctuating because the only

517
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:42,000
real element

518
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,680
Of the open source

519
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:51,600
The only element that actually defines its stability is related to motivation

520
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:59,000
And motivation can be of two types, indeed it can be of different types

521
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:06,240
But let's say the most striking elements are intrinsic and extrinsic motivation

522
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:09,200
Let's call them

523
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:13,120
exogenous and endogenous motivation, therefore internal to yourself

524
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:16,120
that pushes from the outside

525
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:20,800
If at the beginning the motivation is

526
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:25,120
Endogenous

527
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:37,640
So you feel it pushing from the inside, that you want to do something cool, you want to know new topics, and that's fine.

528
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:46,640
In the end, a good part of the motivation in evolution will come to you as an element that comes to you from outside,

529
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:52,640
outside of your control, of social recognition in the community,

530
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:57,640
of becoming a visible element.

531
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:02,640
And this thing, in my opinion, is at high risk.

532
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:05,640
I have a previous experience.

533
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:10,640
Many of you know that in my previous life I was a DJ, in clubs.

534
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:14,060
Okay, and there was a specific period around the year

535
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:21,560
2003 2004 when the djs became the rockstar djs

536
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:25,880
When there was this passage

537
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:28,820
a good part of the tracks

538
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:30,960
were

539
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:37,000
fed, therefore the record production was fed by the search for that

540
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,440
exogenous motivation

541
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:45,440
And so everyone wanted to be rockstar djs to do rockstar djs they had to do more open source

542
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,880
possible no now I'm shifting the perspective

543
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:54,600
Here at the end this thing was a disaster for the world of djs

544
00:50:54,600 --> 00:51:00,520
because all the research part of underground is all lost

545
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:06,480
so when I see in the conference halls the new framework

546
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:15,200
Script the figuissimo Bobo next js puto stock a a tutti vogliono contribuire la

547
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:21,440
questa contributione che guidata prevalentemente dalla parte strinseca e

548
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:26,920
Rischiosa e la mia domanda è a livello personale come ti trovi in questo in questo

549
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:30,160
in questo

550
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:36,920
Allora, c'è tantissimo da dire anche qui, ma mi dispiace per il tempo benvenuto su github

551
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:45,920
I'll start with a recent example that made me think

552
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:51,920
Recently there was the release of BUN, version 1

553
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:57,920
It was a big talk

554
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:04,920
In the Facts of the Species, they were comparing JS and BUN

555
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:15,420
And in the middle of the cycle, one of the leaders of the NoJS team on the performance

556
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:24,420
I don't remember the name, I know that Jag has something on Twitter, I'll get it back to you later

557
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:26,420
I'll get it back later

558
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:30,420
and it ended up in Cyclone's eye

559
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:37,420
because he was the reference of this team

560
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:40,420
and everyone started to talk about it

561
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:43,420
nobody knew who he was

562
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:49,420
and this is already a moral blow to the low

563
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:52,420
that really makes you bleed

564
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:56,420
everyone started to criticize him

565
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:58,420
very funny

566
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:00,420
then it ended

567
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:02,420
in the youtube cycle

568
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:04,420
with the

569
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:06,420
the prisma

570
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:08,420
i will never remember the names

571
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:10,420
they have too complex nicknames

572
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:12,420
the one that always does all the videos

573
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:14,420
prime gem

574
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:16,420
very good prime gem

575
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:18,420
it ended in the cycle

576
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:20,420
and

577
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:22,420
What was the result?

578
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:29,920
He said "Guys, it's all free time, I spend it on improving Nod's performance"

579
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,920
It ended up on Cyclone's eye, it was crushed

580
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:37,920
And the next day, I think, he opened a pull request

581
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:43,920
In which he said "Guys, I'm leaving the performance team"

582
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,920
"Get ready"

583
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:52,920
Here is the danger of open source

584
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:56,920
and also the advantage, in the sense that when you get bored,

585
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:06,920
when you are really targeted as the worst developer of the last 20 years

586
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:11,920
one gets angry, one gets angry and says "but who makes me do it?"

587
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:20,300
And his last tweets were him playing Call of Duty

588
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:29,680
Let's realize that, because sometimes we forget that if there is no Manuel who releases the game

589
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:33,300
And sometimes they ping me, thanks, because I lose them

590
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:37,720
If there is no Manuel who releases the game, the features, the bugfixes and so on

591
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:40,720
they are not released

592
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:45,720
all Fastify maintainers have access and can release them

593
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:48,720
it's clear, I'm not saying that I have a centralized power

594
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,720
but the concept is

595
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,720
treat us like people

596
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:56,720
we are human beings too

597
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,720
but it's not the same as in a company

598
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,720
because then I relate to what you said before

599
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:03,720
only that, apart from the fact that in a company they pay you

600
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:05,720
and maybe the boss is one or two

601
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:07,720
it's not all about the internet

602
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:09,720
but it's a similar thing

603
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:11,720
if you want to be good

604
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:13,720
if a person feels good in an environment

605
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:15,720
that can be his own project

606
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:17,720
it doesn't go away

607
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:19,720
if it goes away, it's obviously not

608
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:21,720
something that comes from the outside

609
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:23,720
but it's much easier

610
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:25,720
since those who use fastify

611
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:27,720
don't pay you

612
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:29,720
to say "hey, if you don't like me, go away"

613
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:31,720
and then you don't realize

614
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:33,720
that you're actually leaving us

615
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:43,720
I would like to add a note of folklore, a post that I share on our backchannel today, on the performances of Node.js.

616
00:55:43,720 --> 00:56:01,720
Today, Jared Summer has shared on Twitter, a link to an issue that he had raised in 2021 regarding the Node.js performances.

617
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:09,720
Our mutual friend Matteo has made one of his and he gave a beautiful answer.

618
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:22,720
He wrote "Imagine a different world where you open a pull request to fix this and become a Node collaborator making it work even faster".

619
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:24,720
This is...

620
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:27,520
This is something that...

621
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,520
In my opinion, it's pure psychology.

622
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,520
At this moment, I was thinking about Matteo Collina,

623
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:33,520
who is really pissed off when he sees this.

624
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,520
Okay?

625
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,520
And he says, "What do I do?"

626
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,520
"Do I feed the flame in a way...

627
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:43,520
Huh? Or do I try to..."

628
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:45,520
- In a constructive way! - In a nice way.

629
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:47,520
Actually, it's a big-ass joke.

630
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,520
But at least...

631
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:51,520
At least he made me understand,

632
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:56,520
that you can communicate in a slightly ironic,

633
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:59,520
pungent, but also polite way.

634
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:02,520
I've seen the worst things in the ban context.

635
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:06,520
Yes, however, the first tweet was also pungent,

636
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,520
how to say, controversial.

637
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:10,520
I mean, he meant, "I opened it in 2021,

638
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:12,520
no one has sh*t on me,

639
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:15,520
I did my run time with..."

640
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:16,520
Blackjack.

641
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:18,520
"Blackjack, the Russian guy."

642
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:42,520
Actually, between No Jays and Banner, I'm seeing a flame between the beginning of the game and the other games, like Symphony of the Aravel and Symphony of the Colors.

643
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:49,720
I wanted to ask you a question that has nothing to do with it, but it's related to what we were saying before, at the beginning.

644
00:57:49,720 --> 00:58:01,120
In your opinion, how can we create an open source training process?

645
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:04,720
I'll tell you something like this.

646
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:09,360
a few years ago, to participate in a workshop

647
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:15,560
held by GNOME contributors and maintainers

648
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:18,880
on how to make a pull request on GNOME

649
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:23,520
and how the architecture worked in general.

650
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:29,680
So, it was a mistake to work on a...

651
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:31,880
not on the desktop environment,

652
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:35,480
if that would have been utopian to do the workshop interview

653
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:39,980
but on an application that was included by default in the desktop environment

654
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:48,780
so to see a little how to integrate the UI with GTK inside GNOME

655
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:53,280
how to use BUS in the way everyone expects to use BUS

656
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:59,180
in short, it was a session on how to introduce people

657
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:04,680
that were never developed for Gnome

658
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:07,680
because, like all open source projects,

659
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:11,180
they need people to contribute to them.

660
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:14,180
In my opinion, is it possible to do something like that?

661
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:17,180
It's just a matter of fact,

662
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:21,680
I don't have any idea about projects in the ecosystem.

663
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:24,180
As I said, it can be or not.

664
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:27,180
If tomorrow morning I want to wake up and say

665
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:37,180
I know about C++, I know about JavaScript, I want to contribute to this thing here. Where can I start?

666
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:47,180
So, clearly, as the initial title says, it depends.

667
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:55,180
I clearly remember that the Node.js Core project has several talks

668
00:59:55,180 --> 01:00:03,180
where, in live, the person explained the Node.js codebase for a moment

669
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:08,180
because it is clearly very important in terms of dimensions

670
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:13,180
and it did a pull request during the talk

671
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:16,180
so this kind of training is there

672
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:20,180
but many projects don't have it

673
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:27,180
and certainly the initial entry barrier

674
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:31,180
for people who are approaching

675
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:35,180
I'm assuming that at least Git knows it

676
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:47,180
because we often had people who closed the pull request and created a new one every time you asked them to change something

677
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:58,180
and so you train them and tell them "read a bit of GitHub's documentation, which is very well done, so you can explain the pull request process"

678
01:00:58,180 --> 01:01:14,180
I think that explaining the codebase lowers the level of fear that a normal person has as soon as they approach a framework

679
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:23,180
because you feel a bit out of place, where do I start, where do I not start, the first steps, these things here

680
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:31,180
would simplify the entry barrier a lot, in my opinion.

681
01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:37,180
I don't think I've seen it done a lot, honestly.

682
01:01:37,180 --> 01:01:43,180
And on Fastify there's definitely a high level.

683
01:01:43,180 --> 01:01:50,180
There's the contributing file, which explains the basic steps.

684
01:01:50,180 --> 01:02:00,180
you fork, you check out, you modify the code and then you start the pull request process

685
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:12,180
but something that explains the codebase, that explains where the validation is, that explains how the validation works, that explains these things doesn't exist

686
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:26,180
It needs a little bit of strength from the developer

687
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:31,180
and he says "ok, I don't know the apocode base, I have to start reading it"

688
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:36,180
I start, obviously from the package.json and I look at the starting point

689
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:40,180
and from there I try to understand the "smoke" cycle

690
01:02:40,180 --> 01:02:42,180
because otherwise...

691
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:48,180
let's say, if you wait...

692
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:53,180
when I say that the maintainer accompanies you like San Francesco

693
01:02:53,180 --> 01:02:55,180
taking you by the hand, etc.

694
01:02:55,180 --> 01:02:57,180
it's not really like that

695
01:02:57,180 --> 01:02:59,180
I should say that it's more like the Spartans

696
01:02:59,180 --> 01:03:02,180
He accompanies you by taking you by the ass, maybe it's better

697
01:03:02,180 --> 01:03:04,180
It's more like the Spartans

698
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:06,180
he takes you and throws you in the forest

699
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:09,180
if you survive and go, you'll get out of it faster

700
01:03:09,180 --> 01:03:25,180
But yes, learning to read the code is the first step, unfortunately, when you don't have a light accompanying process to the codebase.

701
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:31,180
Sorry, I just want to make a small remark on this. I use the podcast as a personal thing.

702
01:03:31,180 --> 01:03:35,180
Right on this topic I will do a talk at Code in Motion

703
01:03:35,180 --> 01:03:37,180
on the exploration of codebase

704
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:41,180
So if you come to Code in Motion, I'll be waiting for you

705
01:03:41,180 --> 01:03:43,180
with the flags, the stripes

706
01:03:43,180 --> 01:03:49,180
I wanted to say about this thing

707
01:03:49,180 --> 01:03:52,180
that I did some talks on some conferences on Aravel

708
01:03:52,180 --> 01:03:55,180
starting from that reason

709
01:03:55,180 --> 01:03:57,180
because I didn't understand how some things worked

710
01:03:57,180 --> 01:04:04,180
The documentation is explained very well, but for how to use a feature, but to know how it works,

711
01:04:04,180 --> 01:04:10,180
because I was interested in that, because sometimes you reach edge cases that are not explained in the documentation,

712
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:21,180
and exploring, I did several talks on some aspects of Laravel, on the template engine, on the authorization.

713
01:04:21,180 --> 01:04:26,180
Actually, you realize that Laravel is a PHP-based framework, so we're not talking about PHP,

714
01:04:26,180 --> 01:04:29,680
where there are also things called to the system, but a much more complex thing.

715
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:37,680
But they have been very appreciated, because even if one does not contribute to the codebase of Laravel,

716
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:42,680
when he writes the code, he knows what happens underneath, and therefore he knows what to fix,

717
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:47,180
and if he should find some bugs, he also knows where to go to see,

718
01:04:47,180 --> 01:04:50,680
which thanks to the ideas like PHPStorm

719
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:52,180
it's easy to get into it

720
01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:55,680
you just click on a function and it brings you into the framework

721
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:59,680
and you see that it's PHP code, there's nothing else

722
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:03,680
then PHP loads everything in a PHP file and executes it

723
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:08,680
I have to say that, just to connect to the Telegram group

724
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:13,680
seeing that "go to" inside Laravel's codebase was beautiful

725
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:16,180
I didn't see it, but it must be one of those secrets

726
01:05:16,180 --> 01:05:18,680
like there are some Easter eggs in Monkey Island.

727
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:20,680
And then another thing I wanted to say

728
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:23,180
about a complex codebase like Node.js,

729
01:05:23,180 --> 01:05:27,180
Paolo Insogna, who we all know,

730
01:05:27,180 --> 01:05:30,680
he's part of Nirvana, he's someone who talks a lot,

731
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:36,180
he's a core contributor of HTTP and something else,

732
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:37,680
he says he doesn't know anything else.

733
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:42,680
So we can't even claim to know the whole codebase

734
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:44,680
to have the knowledge of the frameworks.

735
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:52,680
If you're working on the HTTP, the stream, like Matteo was doing a lot in the stream,

736
01:05:52,680 --> 01:06:00,680
you focus on that, and that's enough to make you, if you want to,

737
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:07,680
your position in the contributor, but we can't know everything.

738
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:10,680
In some way, we have to trust something, so we have to follow our instincts

739
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:15,680
and see what we like and what we don't like about such a big database.

740
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:20,680
I wanted to go back to a topic we left unsaid for a moment,

741
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:23,680
and that is the topic of motivation.

742
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:28,680
Sorry if I jump ahead, but I've found a tweet of yours,

743
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:30,680
which we're watching right now.

744
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:34,680
Actually, you can imagine it, because you're not watching it, but it will be on YouTube.

745
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:35,680
No, really.

746
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:57,680
And it's a tweet that says "Sometimes I wonder why I'm doing open source, managing a thousand small modules, rather than making the big tool that would give me great visibility"

747
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:00,680
Did I get it right? More or less, that was the meaning?

748
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:06,080
That's exactly the point you gave us

749
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:10,080
Going back to your previous question

750
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:15,080
where I told you "yes, we know how to move, we know how to chop meat"

751
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:18,080
for the poor maintainer of Nod

752
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:24,580
But, attention, that's a cause for which we give up everything

753
01:07:24,580 --> 01:07:30,580
that is, the community really treats you like a dirty rag

754
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:39,580
the other motivation, on which I feel a little inside, if I have to be honest

755
01:07:39,580 --> 01:07:42,580
is that I have achieved my goals

756
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:47,580
I had set some goals when I started to contribute to Open Source

757
01:07:47,580 --> 01:07:49,580
and I have achieved them

758
01:07:49,580 --> 01:07:54,080
and now I have to find new goals

759
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:58,080
and look for new motivation

760
01:07:58,080 --> 01:07:59,580
basically

761
01:07:59,580 --> 01:08:03,580
and it's not an easy search, in my opinion

762
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:06,580
and I'm in that phase

763
01:08:06,580 --> 01:08:12,080
and that tweet condenses exactly what I'm trying now

764
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:16,580
because, often and willingly

765
01:08:16,580 --> 01:08:28,580
If a pull request is emerged, ok, good, but if it is not released, your code remains on GitHub and that's it.

766
01:08:28,580 --> 01:08:35,580
So there are daily operations that I find myself doing.

767
01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:42,860
check the notifications on the github, check all the billions of pull requests

768
01:08:42,860 --> 01:08:49,660
that the pendabot sends and press mark as done after having done if they give them all

769
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:58,540
and now for me it's routine, now I do it automatically

770
01:08:58,540 --> 01:09:10,940
I have my tool, "LazyFy", which is kept together with the tape, probably older than my grandmother

771
01:09:10,940 --> 01:09:19,740
but it does its job, and I don't intend to update it, honestly, because... who makes me do it?

772
01:09:19,740 --> 01:09:27,740
I'm in that phase, I'm in the phase where I see a lot of content creators

773
01:09:27,740 --> 01:09:32,740
that make a career, that get great results

774
01:09:32,740 --> 01:09:39,740
and for great results, guys, let's be clear, I'm not just talking about money

775
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:47,740
but I'm talking about, for example, if you need a beautiful O1 visa for America

776
01:09:47,740 --> 01:09:55,740
and you don't have a degree, like in my case, you need to have won awards

777
01:09:55,740 --> 01:10:02,740
if you won the MVP or the Google Developer Expert, these things here

778
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:10,740
you can ask for a VISTO or ONE, which is crazy if you think about it

779
01:10:10,740 --> 01:10:16,340
and so you see people who use what you do,

780
01:10:16,340 --> 01:10:20,940
go further than what you've never done before

781
01:10:20,940 --> 01:10:25,140
and so it's a bit of a drag, it's a drag on the inside, yeah, of course

782
01:10:25,140 --> 01:10:31,140
on this, they're talking about envy, is envy bad as an emotion?

783
01:10:31,140 --> 01:10:37,740
Yes, a bit, yes, but if we take envy and, how to say,

784
01:10:37,740 --> 01:10:41,740
if we become sour, it's bad

785
01:10:41,740 --> 01:10:45,740
but if we take this envy and transform it into motivation

786
01:10:45,740 --> 01:10:49,740
or admiration

787
01:10:49,740 --> 01:10:55,740
I don't know if I admire all these content creators

788
01:10:55,740 --> 01:11:01,740
anyway, you take it and transform it into energy

789
01:11:01,740 --> 01:11:05,740
to find new goals

790
01:11:05,740 --> 01:11:09,740
and then say "ok, you know what?

791
01:11:09,740 --> 01:11:13,740
the plugin should be re-made"

792
01:11:13,740 --> 01:11:17,740
I'm ok with that, I know how to use it

793
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:21,740
and if someone wants to use it again,

794
01:11:21,740 --> 01:11:25,740
they should do it, otherwise

795
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:29,740
I work on my projects, and in the last

796
01:11:29,740 --> 01:11:33,740
4-5 months I've been doing this

797
01:11:33,740 --> 01:11:37,180
I'm doing maintenance for sure, for the Fastify projects

798
01:11:37,180 --> 01:11:43,020
I was going back to the train on Sunday, there were the test of Fastify that didn't work

799
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:47,180
I fixed them, a little bit of maintenance, I have to do it

800
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:50,780
But big features, I'm not doing them

801
01:11:50,780 --> 01:11:56,540
The last big feature I think is in July, June

802
01:11:56,540 --> 01:12:01,900
So I'm going a little bit slow if I have to be honest

803
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:05,900
And what does this mean for you, community?

804
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:13,900
It means that the 5.0 version of Fastify, if we don't implement all the necessary things,

805
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:17,900
it won't be released at the beginning of next year.

806
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:19,900
It will be released, maybe, at the end.

807
01:12:19,900 --> 01:12:22,900
Now, clearly, there's Matteo with his startup,

808
01:12:22,900 --> 01:12:26,900
he's really giving a crazy boost to Fastify.

809
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:31,900
but it may not be enough

810
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:38,900
and this goes back to the discussion we made about sustainability

811
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:44,900
if the currency you pay with, or one of the few currencies you pay with

812
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:50,900
all the effort, the visibility, when it doesn't arrive, the land starts to falter

813
01:12:50,900 --> 01:12:56,900
If you are that programmer in Massachusetts or in Culandia

814
01:12:56,900 --> 01:12:59,900
who manages the module that does...

815
01:12:59,900 --> 01:13:04,900
(as far as JavaScript is concerned, this is very present)

816
01:13:04,900 --> 01:13:08,900
the module that does a specific thing but nobody cares about it

817
01:13:08,900 --> 01:13:11,900
because it is used by everyone...

818
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:13,900
but... well...

819
01:13:13,900 --> 01:13:15,900
an example...

820
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:18,900
Babel is quite famous, right?

821
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:28,900
but we could draw the example of some modulino that is everywhere and no one gives a shit about it

822
01:13:28,900 --> 01:13:35,900
in the end you really risk that the whole industry that is built above does not hold

823
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:41,900
very simple, because the currency with which it is paying is the "we want if it's good"

824
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:47,900
and among other things "we want if it's good" does not always hold because there are shitty bullets

825
01:13:47,900 --> 01:13:51,900
because the new super framework is coming out

826
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:54,900
which has the investment fund under its hood

827
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:56,900
which is unhooking cash

828
01:13:56,900 --> 01:14:00,900
and we are building the products

829
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:03,900
It was quite recent, a few months ago

830
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:06,900
I don't remember which project, Node.js

831
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:09,900
that Mantini said "I won't do it anymore

832
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:11,900
because I saw that whoever uses it"

833
01:14:11,900 --> 01:14:15,900
and we were talking about Microsoft, Google, etc

834
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:20,900
I don't do it anymore, I asked for help and no one gives me a penny

835
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:26,900
so I quit and you keep it. I don't remember the name of the event

836
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:32,900
I remember the event that made a big impact on Twitter

837
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:37,900
but then nothing was done there

838
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:39,900
Yes

839
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:45,960
I would say, I was looking at the time, I actually have a lot of questions

840
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:48,620
I want to ask you one

841
01:14:48,620 --> 01:14:51,020
that

842
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:56,920
you manage, in addition to the codebase, in some way you collaborate in addition to the codebase of Fastify, also

843
01:14:56,920 --> 01:15:01,720
has a gazillion of plugins, because how Fastify did everything

844
01:15:02,900 --> 01:15:09,480
Can be a plugin. You said you have your tooling to do it when there are hundreds of

845
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:14,500
A poly rep that touches hundreds of points

846
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:20,860
How how how how how how you manage them that you have

847
01:15:20,860 --> 01:15:26,380
So, of course, the ocean board is a

848
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:37,340
a project that has open source on github very banal very spartan version 0 but it works and simply

849
01:15:37,340 --> 01:15:46,780
At a regular rate it takes all the information from github and puts them on a table in ocean

850
01:15:46,780 --> 01:15:54,340
End this is basic this gives me the overview of the projects and what I do by looking

851
01:15:56,180 --> 01:16:01,880
This table I look at which repositories have more open issues

852
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:08,060
Because and then I go to check there was some problem

853
01:16:08,060 --> 01:16:12,660
if a repository is too much and this part means that

854
01:16:12,660 --> 01:16:16,140
It's staying a little behind with the review

855
01:16:16,140 --> 01:16:23,100
I do this kind of analysis this usually on Saturday morning

856
01:16:24,220 --> 01:16:30,460
Instead, for the releases, I rely on the guitar notifications.

857
01:16:30,460 --> 01:16:35,340
I have constantly 300 notifications, basically.

858
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:42,940
And I go to a hundred a day, which is constantly refilled the next day.

859
01:16:42,940 --> 01:16:50,580
So when I see something that has been merged, or something that has been approved by other people,

860
01:16:50,580 --> 01:16:54,580
I emerge and off I go on the launch ramp.

861
01:16:54,580 --> 01:16:58,780
So, it's a routine now.

862
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:02,700
It's a routine that requires to be done.

863
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:10,260
You can't hear me, right?

864
01:17:10,260 --> 01:17:12,980
Here, as the opening says, right?

865
01:17:12,980 --> 01:17:17,380
This time it's not five minutes, but I was talking without a microphone.

866
01:17:20,460 --> 01:17:32,180
I would have liked to talk about Fastify, but we don't have the time, we'll probably do a day where we'll try to talk in detail about Fastify

867
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:38,780
and do an episode like "Fastify vs Express" or "Fastify vs Nest"

868
01:17:38,780 --> 01:17:45,260
But I know that Carmine has a question about Fastify that he can't keep to himself

869
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:52,260
Actually it's not a question about FF6 but in general, because this is something we often ask ourselves

870
01:17:52,260 --> 01:17:56,260
and we also asked our internal group of hosts of Github a few weeks ago

871
01:17:56,260 --> 01:18:04,260
Why JavaScript, in your opinion, unlike PHP, Ruby, Python, doesn't have...

872
01:18:04,260 --> 01:18:15,260
But, leaving out NEST, I don't want to go into my opinions, please, if you want to do Java, do Java, Java is really nice

873
01:18:15,260 --> 01:18:25,760
But, in your opinion, why isn't there a monolithic framework, I don't mean by reference, because there are different ecosystems

874
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:37,560
Why isn't there a monolithic framework or opinionated to do production, to do RAD, but also the equivalent of Rails for JavaScript?

875
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:48,560
I remember that a while ago, I'm talking about years ago, when I started, there was something about IBM Loop something, but then I think that it has also lost that in Ether.

876
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:58,560
Why? There's no need and if Fastify can become something like that,

877
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:02,560
by joining it to some plugins, a bit like React,

878
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:08,560
which was born as a UI framework but with various libraries around it,

879
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:13,560
it can become something more structured for single-page applications

880
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:18,560
for things that are a bit different from his original goal

881
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:20,560
Well...

882
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:24,560
I don't know if I should answer with a marketing question

883
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:29,560
and I look at Leonardo's shirt

884
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:34,560
otherwise the direct answer to your question is

885
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:35,560
marketing

886
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:37,560
I'm done

887
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:47,060
In my opinion it's just a matter of advertising all the various features that a framework can have

888
01:19:47,060 --> 01:19:49,960
And then...

889
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:54,960
A framework that does everything will probably do everything wrong

890
01:19:54,960 --> 01:20:01,160
I always have this opinion, honestly

891
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:13,760
and as soon as you leave the seeding, it becomes a very impervious road

892
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:20,760
and so it's necessary, I don't know, sometimes I have the idea

893
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:28,760
but if we all worked on the same project, if we all worked on the same things

894
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:33,760
we will live in the future

895
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:37,760
and I don't know how true this is

896
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:41,760
sorry, I just remembered

897
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:45,760
there was a framework called Sales

898
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:49,760
I don't know if it still exists

899
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:53,760
there are two, one is Sales, JS

900
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:57,760
and the other is Adonis, which is a bit more apart

901
01:20:57,760 --> 01:21:02,760
The truth is that they are not famous and structured

902
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:05,760
The one with IBM is called Loopback

903
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:07,760
Loopback, yes, yes

904
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:09,760
Let's leave Loopback

905
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:14,760
But on this thing, coming from the world of PHP with Aravel

906
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:18,760
Even now, if I have to think about it

907
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:20,760
If I had to make a full stack application

908
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:23,760
I've always done it with Aravel because it already had everything integrated

909
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:35,760
If I had to do API, I used Node.js with API, which was the JSON part of Express, and then Fastify.

910
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:40,760
But it's as if in JavaScript this problem wasn't solved.

911
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:45,760
If it wasn't solved, I would think there was a reason, because I don't think anyone thought about it.

912
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:49,760
But maybe in the meantime there was a division between doing the backend and doing the frontend,

913
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:54,080
the frontend, which was very separate, because I said, ok, I have to do the frontend in a way

914
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:59,600
and then call the API with a framework, a web server, or whatever we want to call it,

915
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:04,520
that is fast to do API. Then you have to do your side project and you lose

916
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:10,520
four and a half days doing scaffolding. And your friend with Aravel has already deployed,

917
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:16,840
gone out to the market and is already monetizing. Exactly, the thing is that, in the sense, there is

918
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:23,560
There's NEST, or Nezaho NEST, which is a pretty cool thing, but the world is beautiful because it's diverse

919
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:30,080
But, in the sense of something that has the speed, the robustness and the documentation of

920
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:34,240
Linux, Rails, Laravel, Symfony, I don't know, in the sense of

921
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:38,480
It's something that I think is missing and could be useful to a lot of people

922
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:45,240
But, here I put the disclaimer, something that doesn't go to mock the other frameworks

923
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:53,240
Or better, if I find myself in the same situation where the class is already written to make the controller, well, I already have it nested.

924
01:22:53,240 --> 01:23:01,240
So having something that is well integrated into the language and that connects me to do my things.

925
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:13,240
I mean, I don't know, if I had to do it as my side project, but I'm no one, I don't know, it would be like an extension of the current Cli of Fastify.

926
01:23:13,240 --> 01:23:20,400
I would do the project scaffolding, but maybe I would give you some options with the more or less official plugins, etc.

927
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:23,080
to do something more structured.

928
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:29,200
In the sense, Fastify with the click, with the autoloading of things is going in that direction.

929
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:35,480
The fact that I put things in a terminated folder according to a certain convention

930
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:38,080
and I find them according to that certain convention,

931
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:41,680
it goes a lot in the direction of this type of product.

932
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:46,680
my hope is that maybe by following this direction

933
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:52,680
we can provide more opinionated choices on certain things

934
01:23:52,680 --> 01:23:57,680
and while before we were saying that if a framework does everything, maybe it doesn't do it well

935
01:23:57,680 --> 01:24:01,680
there's the Lorocto that is turning on the Lamborghini

936
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:04,680
but in the sense that...

937
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:09,680
a framework... sorry, I'm recalculating

938
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:11,680
because often it's a framework...

939
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:16,680
Manuel, we often talk about the context where we work,

940
01:24:16,680 --> 01:24:21,680
which is often a context of quite complicated applications,

941
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:23,680
very large, many microservices,

942
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:26,680
where I would never use Laravel or similar,

943
01:24:26,680 --> 01:24:30,680
but I need to have control over every small component.

944
01:24:30,680 --> 01:24:34,680
In the context, I return to the small agency,

945
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:39,680
because the market has that breadth.

946
01:24:39,680 --> 01:24:43,680
So I return mentally to the small agency and I think,

947
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:52,680
if I have to create a site for a client,

948
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:56,680
I have to pull it up in four days,

949
01:24:56,680 --> 01:24:58,680
because these are the deadlines,

950
01:24:58,680 --> 01:25:01,680
I have to pull it up for yesterday, with authentication,

951
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:03,680
Un piccolo panelino

952
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:10,400
L invio di mail a quel punto farlo con confusione di con la prima cosa che faccio installo fastify

953
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:17,120
Ok, puoi ci vuol mettere l'inter e ci vuol mettere prettier e ceo fare questo e poi il plugin di

954
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:22,560
Di di loghi quale utilizzo quindi in realtà quel fastify a tutto

955
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:27,040
quello che manca e il glue code che ci mette ritutto

956
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:33,480
Yes, but it's also a matter of standardization, I mean, it's true if I have to do my own service, the complex code, I have to use a framework

957
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:37,640
But, yes, SNI, I mean, if I talk about my personal experience

958
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:43,080
We have a complex product, which is Trent, a system of coins, blah blah blah, several services

959
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:46,120
But they are made with Phoenix, in the Phoenix way

960
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:51,560
But the same thing, we could do it with Rails, we could do it with Django, with something else

961
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:56,440
what the framework gives you are binaries that are battle-tested,

962
01:25:56,440 --> 01:26:00,080
that have sensible defaults,

963
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:04,160
that allow you to focus on your business logic,

964
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:05,160
on what really matters,

965
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:07,040
which can be the little panel,

966
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:09,040
or the system of...

967
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:13,640
or an iterating, or the next distributed system, etc.

968
01:26:13,640 --> 01:26:18,760
That obviously also depends on the type of technology you have chosen,

969
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:21,360
but for me the framework is useful because it gives you guidelines,

970
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:25,360
that allows you to focus on infrastructural things that

971
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:29,360
either you can't do or you don't know how to do or that take your time

972
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:32,360
and that can be already standardized

973
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:36,360
I always like to repeat that if you have to spend 40 hours

974
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:41,360
to make your routing system, your ORM, your query builder, whatever you want

975
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:46,360
it means that you don't have your product

976
01:26:46,360 --> 01:26:55,360
and if you can afford to spend 40 hours on these bullshit that have already been solved in 15 different languages

977
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:59,360
rather than writing a piece of business logic.

978
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:03,360
Probably it's the nth crude with a nice marketing department

979
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:08,360
and there's nothing wrong with it, but at this point it uses the right tool.

980
01:27:08,360 --> 01:27:16,360
It's not about the number, but in the recording date of this podcast

981
01:27:16,360 --> 01:27:19,360
the Platformatic 1.0 came out.

982
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:21,360
This episode is not sponsored

983
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:23,360
But it has nothing to do with what we talked about.

984
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:26,360
We take care of that. I mean, I am paid by the strong Platformatic powers

985
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:29,360
so I had to bring this thing.

986
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:35,360
You can say this, because people understand

987
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:38,360
I would like to say it too, guys, it's about to be...

988
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:41,360
It's about to be, we released a few weeks ago

989
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:45,360
a new version of Trent, the monitoring tool for the two clusters

990
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:48,360
No, I swear

991
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:56,360
If you want to see it, I think it's a bit different

992
01:27:56,360 --> 01:28:00,360
compared to the platform one

993
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:02,360
but on SAP...

994
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:11,360
Carmine, I'll just send you a sentence

995
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:14,360
to answer you

996
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:17,360
I repeat, marketing

997
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:20,360
because I put some links in the chat

998
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:23,360
that will be included in the night of the episode

999
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:28,360
There was a project Fastify DX that had this purpose

1000
01:28:28,360 --> 01:28:32,360
But, here it is, what happened?

1001
01:28:32,360 --> 01:28:38,360
The only maintainer that was actively working on it, is basically not working anymore

1002
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:49,360
So it's true that the Fastify organization has a lot of lack of people that the frontend knows as its pockets

1003
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:56,360
and another link I sent you is my repository on github, Receptify

1004
01:28:56,360 --> 01:29:03,360
which is a refactor of an existing application that was on Express

1005
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:11,360
and that one has everything, it has a React web application with Vite

1006
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:15,360
and it has the OAuth authentication with Spotify

1007
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:19,480
a little bit of API to show a little bit of data

1008
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:21,480
very simple

1009
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:26,560
is that marketing takes away more time than managing

1010
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:29,880
a thousand thousand repositories

1011
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:31,880
and really

1012
01:29:31,880 --> 01:29:35,800
if there were people who want to contribute to the open source

1013
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:40,880
but he is not a programmer but he is simply a marketing person

1014
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:45,880
that could really find so much space and visibility

1015
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:50,880
within open source channels that I think you have no idea about.

1016
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:58,880
And on this sentence, and remembering that marketing takes time but also a lot of money,

1017
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:02,880
and Next.js is an example,

1018
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:15,880
Let's go to the village of Baluchi, because if we don't open this Pandora's box, we'll stay for another two days and we're already an hour and a half.

1019
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:26,880
So I wanted to ask you, classic question, here there will be the fantastic Sigletta, but I wanted to ask you, do you have something to share with us?

1020
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:32,880
a book, a talk, a video, something that has caught your attention.

1021
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:37,880
So, I ask Manuel, did you bring something for us?

1022
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:40,880
I'm taking you to the country of the Balochi!

1023
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:42,880
Ah, the country of the Balochi!

1024
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:51,880
So, I don't want to bring things as a developer, that's enough.

1025
01:30:51,880 --> 01:30:56,600
I'm taking my life into my own hands and I'll bring a book

1026
01:30:56,600 --> 01:30:59,160
which is a role-playing game

1027
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:01,640
made by an Italian

1028
01:31:01,640 --> 01:31:04,280
which is called "Fabula Ultima"

1029
01:31:04,280 --> 01:31:07,800
it's an old-style role-playing game

1030
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:12,680
you have to take the manual, read it, then find some friends, a group of enthusiasts

1031
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:13,720
and play it

1032
01:31:13,720 --> 01:31:17,000
exactly, I saw the D&D DAD

1033
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:29,000
So I really recommend it if you like the anime style, it's very beautiful, very exciting I must say

1034
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:36,000
And a second "balocco" which is a videogame

1035
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:42,000
A few episodes ago it was presented by The Messenger and Sea of Stars

1036
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:47,000
On that false line I recommend "Sword of Convalaria"

1037
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:53,000
It's not out yet, but I think it really deserves it

1038
01:31:53,000 --> 01:32:01,000
And let's remember that the free time spent relaxing is not wasted time

1039
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:11,000
It's holy, it's very holy. Words, the applause should have started but I couldn't find the button.

1040
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:14,000
It happens. Carmine, Leo?

1041
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:23,000
So, I don't have a book, actually, but something that might be useful to you,

1042
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:30,000
because I think I was laughing at 60% of the problems with my desk,

1043
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:35,000
moving them in the bottom, because I can't see them,

1044
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:40,000
I bought a docking station,

1045
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:43,000
which is one of those things that probably

1046
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:47,000
who has the Mac, the new one, the new Holy Fancy,

1047
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:51,000
with less ports but faster, already has...

1048
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
Holy Fancy?

1049
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
Fancy...

1050
01:32:55,000 --> 01:33:05,320
who has OnlyFans probably already has the hang of putting the light, the webcam, the other things

1051
01:33:05,320 --> 01:33:10,840
so yes, a docking station, which in reality has become something extremely common

1052
01:33:10,840 --> 01:33:15,400
precisely among those who have a Mac, in the sense that I inform myself on YouTube

1053
01:33:15,400 --> 01:33:19,240
in all the common portals and it is full of these videos

1054
01:33:19,240 --> 01:33:24,040
the docking station that changed my life and I'm on all the Macs

1055
01:33:24,040 --> 01:33:33,780
I took one of the Lenovo, for my computer that is a ThinkPad, but it is compatible with almost anything

1056
01:33:33,780 --> 01:33:46,840
so you have this box and you can transform it, basically bring it to your desktop

1057
01:33:46,840 --> 01:33:52,440
It's available in 15,000 versions, all with different prices.

1058
01:33:52,440 --> 01:33:57,840
Don't get fooled, I've already been fooled.

1059
01:33:57,840 --> 01:34:00,240
Don't do it.

1060
01:34:00,240 --> 01:34:05,640
I confirm, because I also have a Lenovo docking station,

1061
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:06,640
thanks MongoDB,

1062
01:34:06,640 --> 01:34:10,240
and it works very well with Mac, it also works with Lenovo,

1063
01:34:10,240 --> 01:34:14,240
so it's all USB-C, there are no problems.

1064
01:34:14,240 --> 01:34:21,240
There are problems sometimes with Linux for the display driver, that stuff, but it's a niche thing, but we don't talk about it.

1065
01:34:21,240 --> 01:34:26,240
Instead, I bring a podcast that has nothing to do with programming, as usual,

1066
01:34:26,240 --> 01:34:29,240
which is called "Very Human Things".

1067
01:34:29,240 --> 01:34:34,240
I recently discovered it, it's a daily podcast, 7 days out of 7, very short, 5-6 minutes,

1068
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:37,240
which talks about things.

1069
01:34:37,240 --> 01:34:40,240
I'll read you some titles

1070
01:34:40,240 --> 01:34:43,240
"Nose and ears grow forever"

1071
01:34:43,240 --> 01:34:46,240
"Why does the bianco exist after meals?"

1072
01:34:46,240 --> 01:34:48,240
"What is the Bird Strike?"

1073
01:34:48,240 --> 01:34:50,240
Then there's a beautiful thing that was

1074
01:34:50,240 --> 01:34:52,240
"Why can't we have wheels?"

1075
01:34:52,240 --> 01:34:58,240
So in six minutes, you understand, a new concept that can be up-to-date

1076
01:34:58,240 --> 01:34:59,240
but also of history like this

1077
01:34:59,240 --> 01:35:01,240
and make a nice figure at the bar

1078
01:35:01,240 --> 01:35:03,240
and since we're in a bar anyway

1079
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:06,240
it seemed great to propose it to me

1080
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:17,240
My balucchi... I actually don't have one. I just have to go and get it. It's a paper.

1081
01:35:17,240 --> 01:35:27,240
The title is "The effects of extrinsic motivation and satisfaction in the development of open source".

1082
01:35:27,240 --> 01:35:29,240
Ah, that's where you found that word.

1083
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:34,240
Well, I don't... I don't know, I'm actually being prepared.

1084
01:35:34,240 --> 01:35:36,240
What have you studied?

1085
01:35:36,240 --> 01:35:44,240
It's a very short paper, because I'm only 26 pages long,

1086
01:35:44,240 --> 01:35:54,240
but super interesting, published in the newspaper of the Association of Informative Systems,

1087
01:35:54,240 --> 01:35:56,240
it's the first time I've heard it,

1088
01:35:56,240 --> 01:36:02,240
but it analyzes the engines that push open source,

1089
01:36:02,240 --> 01:36:04,240
and it made me worry a lot.

1090
01:36:04,240 --> 01:36:06,240
So if you don't want to sleep at night

1091
01:36:06,240 --> 01:36:08,240
thinking about an industry

1092
01:36:08,240 --> 01:36:10,240
that is on the furniture,

1093
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:12,240
this could be a good way to do it.

1094
01:36:12,240 --> 01:36:14,240
Another way to do it

1095
01:36:14,240 --> 01:36:16,240
is a book.

1096
01:36:16,240 --> 01:36:18,240
We didn't talk about it in episode,

1097
01:36:18,240 --> 01:36:20,240
I waited until the last one

1098
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:22,240
because

1099
01:36:22,240 --> 01:36:24,240
I liked it that way.

1100
01:36:24,240 --> 01:36:26,240
It's the book

1101
01:36:26,240 --> 01:36:28,240
that Manuel wrote

1102
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:30,240
together with Maxim and Matteo.

1103
01:36:30,240 --> 01:36:41,240
and Matteo, this one. I didn't download it, I didn't hack it, don't worry, Manuel.

1104
01:36:41,240 --> 01:36:46,480
I had it in preview, by the way. It's a very interesting book for those who are

1105
01:36:46,480 --> 01:36:51,800
getting closer to Fastify and it was exactly what was needed for Fastify.

1106
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:56,760
Of course, everything is on the episode notes and, by the way, the Amazon links

1107
01:36:56,760 --> 01:37:01,280
I'm also in some way, how do you say it was guys?

1108
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:08,880
I'm not affiliated, affiliated, affiliated, now they give us the money, yes, a few cents that

1109
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:16,120
given the costs we have of the 7000 services we took to pass the video

1110
01:37:16,120 --> 01:37:22,480
let's say they're a little stuff but at this point let's say I take this opportunity to remind you

1111
01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:31,480
that if you like it, I support you. I like how Franco Solerio told it in the last episode of Digitalia.

1112
01:37:31,480 --> 01:37:39,480
You see Gitbar as... and here I say, it's the flour of Franco Solerio's bag, this metaphor.

1113
01:37:39,480 --> 01:37:46,480
You see Gitbar as the fruit stand where you can serve yourself and leave the coins or the money out.

1114
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:58,480
So, if you like to support us, if you like Geekbar and you want to help us to continue doing it, you can find the links in the site.

1115
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:08,480
Well, here we are, here we are, we have arrived, I must say that in our back channel I said

1116
01:38:08,480 --> 01:38:13,480
for this new season, the fourth of Geekbar, we will try to stay in an hour, in fact the

1117
01:38:13,480 --> 01:38:20,480
time is 1 hour 40, so I would say that we can close.

1118
01:38:20,480 --> 01:38:29,480
I thank Manuel very much for coming to see us, I know that you will also be

1119
01:38:29,480 --> 01:38:45,480
with us, so we will have a chance to drink a real beer, so thank you for accepting our invitation, thank you from the bottom of my heart.

1120
01:38:45,480 --> 01:38:49,480
Thank you, and here the beer is really good.

1121
01:38:49,480 --> 01:38:52,480
It's a lot. Good and a lot.

1122
01:38:52,480 --> 01:38:57,480
Hi Carmine, hi Leo. How did this episode go?

1123
01:38:57,480 --> 01:39:00,480
Only videos? You thought I was going to leave you.

1124
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:03,480
What do you mean only videos? There's no audio.

1125
01:39:03,480 --> 01:39:05,480
I want to listen to it again.

1126
01:39:05,480 --> 01:39:08,480
I confess that I always listen to myself in podcasts.

1127
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:11,480
Because I want to hear my voice twice as loud.

1128
01:39:11,480 --> 01:39:16,480
The first podcast only with sign language we could do.

1129
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:19,480
But it could be an experiment, for the fifth season...

1130
01:39:19,480 --> 01:39:21,480
Let's do an experiment!

1131
01:39:21,480 --> 01:39:23,480
We'll make a "Git Barliss"

1132
01:39:23,480 --> 01:39:29,480
It would be cool and above all it would draw attention to accessibility

1133
01:39:29,480 --> 01:39:33,480
I have to say that in this episode we will upload the subtitles

1134
01:39:33,480 --> 01:39:37,480
So I think it's compliant with some screen readers

1135
01:39:37,480 --> 01:39:42,480
So it will be possible to do it, at least I hope so

1136
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:47,480
How was the first episode of the fourth season of Geekbar?

1137
01:39:47,480 --> 01:39:54,480
It's not out yet, so there are no haters comments, so we're good, we're friends.

1138
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:58,480
Sorry, so we're still recording?

1139
01:39:58,480 --> 01:40:01,480
We're still recording, absolutely yes.

1140
01:40:01,480 --> 01:40:07,480
I'll tell you later. Did everything go well?

1141
01:40:07,480 --> 01:40:11,480
So far, so good.

1142
01:40:11,480 --> 01:40:15,400
So, having said that, I give you an appointment for the next episode,

1143
01:40:15,400 --> 01:40:16,800
reminding you of our contracts.

1144
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:18,800
For more info, visit github.com/github

1145
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:20,080
and @brainrepo on Twitter.

1146
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:24,920
Our YouTube channel, at this point, we have to say,

1147
01:40:24,920 --> 01:40:27,640
you can find it by searching for "github".

1148
01:40:27,640 --> 01:40:30,520
On any YouTube channel, you know how it is.

1149
01:40:30,520 --> 01:40:33,840
You look at Telegram, you replace it, you do a "preg replace".

1150
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:36,600
So you can also watch us on your home TV,

1151
01:40:36,600 --> 01:40:39,600
64 inches. Our beautiful faces.

1152
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:41,600
Our beautiful faces.

1153
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:43,600
And our...

1154
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:47,600
Our Tereram group is the best group in Italy,

1155
01:40:47,600 --> 01:40:50,600
which is not like all the other groups, but it's the best.

1156
01:40:50,600 --> 01:40:52,600
Because it doesn't have "Italy" in its name.

1157
01:40:52,600 --> 01:40:54,600
Because it doesn't have "Italy" in its name, exactly.

1158
01:40:54,600 --> 01:40:58,600
It's not "Gitbar Italy", but it's just "Gitbar Italy".

1159
01:40:58,600 --> 01:41:04,600
But someone will invent a programming language called "Gitbar"

1160
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:06,600
and then the group will be called "Git Var Italia"

1161
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:08,600
Exactly

1162
01:41:08,600 --> 01:41:14,600
We are waiting for you to talk to us about anything

1163
01:41:14,600 --> 01:41:16,600
and actually to give you feedback

1164
01:41:16,600 --> 01:41:18,600
A lot of feedback

1165
01:41:18,600 --> 01:41:21,600
This is the first episode we make videos

1166
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:26,600
so we are waiting for your questions and feedback

1167
01:41:26,600 --> 01:41:28,600
on our beautiful sets

1168
01:41:28,600 --> 01:41:30,600
Actually Mauro is the most professional

1169
01:41:30,600 --> 01:41:32,600
I literally had to do...

1170
01:41:32,600 --> 01:41:41,600
I was convinced of something else, so there's the water carafe, the scottex, the beer, the rest, I think.

1171
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:46,600
For the next times we'll organize it better, now I'm going straight to the bathroom.

1172
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:52,600
Well, there's a podcast that records in the bathroom, so...

1173
01:41:52,600 --> 01:42:01,600
Having said that, I remind you to ring the bell, because the normal YouTube channels have the bell, we have the bell.

1174
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:05,040
So I'll see you next week.

1175
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:06,040
Bye guys!

1176
01:42:06,040 --> 01:42:07,040
Bye!

1177
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:08,040
Bye!

1178
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:08,540
Bye bye!

1179
01:42:08,540 --> 01:42:26,780
